# Scarne_Dice

	Scarne's Dice is a turn-based dice game where players score points by rolling a die and then:
	- If they roll a 1, score no point and lose their turn
	- If they roll a 2 to 6:
	- Add the rolled value to their points
	- Choose to either reroll or keep their score and end their turn

	The winner is the first player that reaches (or exceeds) 50 points.
